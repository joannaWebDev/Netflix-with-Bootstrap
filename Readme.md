Netflix homepage built with Bootstrap.
1) Correct creation of the page structure divided by 5 "sections" and a "footer".
2) Appropriate tags to mark the text, images, and lists displayed in the footer menus on the page (links in these menus must be empty). You do not have to play the language selection menu.
3) Built the two forms in the first and fifth sections (they are the same) using and customizeing the Bootstrap form templates.
4) Form validation.
5) Created the contents of the fifth section of the page,by adapting the "Bootsrap accordion".

CSThe elements of the page are arranged following the grid of the page. All sections occupy 100% of the width of the device, although the only contents shown occupying 100% of the width of the device are those located at the top of the first section (“.container- fluid ”); the rest of the contents occupy a smaller width (.container).
2) The page adapts to the various devices.
3) The colors and fonts used correspond to a reasonable resemblance to the model.
4) The use of the “floating labels” effect of placeholders.
