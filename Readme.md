Netflix homepage built with Bootstrap.
1) Correct creation of the page structure divided by 5 "sections" and a "footer".
2) Appropriate tags to mark the text, images, and lists displayed in the footer menus on the page (links in these menus must be empty). You do not have to play the language selection menu.
3) To build the two forms in the first and fifth sections (they are the same) you must use and customize the Bootstrap form templates that you can find in this section of the framework documentation: https://getbootstrap.com /docs/4.5/components/forms/.
4) The use of form validation utilities will be positively assessed. You will find the way to do this in the example of the "checkout" (validation) folders. You can download this example at the following address: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/examples/
5) To create the contents of the fifth section of the page, you must adapt the "Bootsrap accordion" found at this address: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/collapse/# accordion-example It is not essential that the visual result is what the Netflix page shows, but it is important that the accordion is functional.

CSS:
1) That the elements of the page are arranged following the grid of the page. Note that all sections occupy 100% of the width of the device, although the only contents shown occupying 100% of the width of the device are those located at the top of the first section (“.container- fluid ”); the rest of the contents occupy a smaller width (.container).
2) That the page adapts to the various devices.
3) That the colors and fonts used correspond to a reasonable resemblance to the model.
4) The use of the “floating labels” effect of placeholders will be positively assessed. You'll find how to do this in the example of the "floating-labels" folder (placeholder effect that becomes a label). You can download this example at the following address: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/examples/
